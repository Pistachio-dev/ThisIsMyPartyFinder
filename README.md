# MyPF

A simple FFXIV plugin that
1. Saves the info about your (or someone else's) Party Finder listing.
2. Replaces \<mypf\> on any text you write with a link to that listing. Works on macros.

For instance:
>*Blackjack open! \<mypf\> Password: 7777*

Turns to:
>*Blackjack open! Looking for Party (John Fantasyxiv) Password: 7777*
